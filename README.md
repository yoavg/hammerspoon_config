## Window resize / movement

- `cmd+alt + arrows` : resize focused window
- `cmd+alt + /`      : maximize/back
- `cmd+alt + g`      : grid resize
- `ctrl+alt + arrows`: move
- `ctrl+cmd+alt+arrows`: focus (sort of)

- `cmd+alt + [`, `cmd+alt + ]` : window switcher (slow)

## Window tagging and switching
This is the shit.

- `ctrl+alt+cmd + space` : tag a window with a name. 
- `ctrl+alt+cmd + delete` : remove tag from window
- ```ctrl+` ``` : select tag (move to tag) from list
- `ctrl+tab`: next tagged window
- ```cmd+` ```: select window by name
- `ctrl+alt+cmd + c` :show current tag

If tag name has `~` in it (ie the name is `~window` or `bl~a`) then you can switch to the tag by `alt+letter` where letter is the one following `~`.
